# Ablavema's roadmap

A few features I'd like to add. Feel free to suggest more.

## Recent files list.

Probably a must for a launcher of this type. Would need to be able to remember what package a file was opened with
previously, and handle no longer available files and packages. Also bookmarking entries would be useful.

## Display changelog for LTS packages.

The info is actually already being fetched, just no way to display it at the moment.

## Display a dynamic "changelog" between two builds

Would require one to download the source code of Blender to be able to get the commits between two builds. This would
definitely help keeping up with Blender's update speed. Only issue would be implementing a way to select two packages
for comparison. And also how to display the commit titles and bodies in a user-friendly way.

## Custom entries

For things like locally compiled Blender versions. Might be desirable for some people.

## Blender settings management

For creating and managing different profiles for the same version. Could be useful for people who like to customise
a lot. Also for testing other people's settings, since some people create teaching profiles and stuff.

## Command line rendering

For faster renders without the UI overhead. Just configure the render settings in the file, open the launcher, click
on the render button in the file in recent files and see the progress. Ideally. I've never actually rendered through
the CLI, but it sounds like a neat feature on paper.
